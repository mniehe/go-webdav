// travels with them, so a Backend whose tenant predicate is wrong would
// otherwise disclose another collection's contents.

// This is deliberately stricter than ChildHref, which confines client-supplied
// multiget hrefs and admits the collection itself or any descendant. A calendar
// or address book holds its members directly, so a nested path is not one of
